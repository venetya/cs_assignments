/*
Daphne invests $100 at 10% simple interest. (That is, every year, the investment earns
an interest equal to 10% of the original investment.) Deirdre invests $100 at 5% interest
compounded annually. (That is, interest is 5% of the current balance, including previous
addition of interest.) Write a program that finds how many years it takes for the value of
Deirdreâ€™s investment to exceed the value of Daphneâ€™s investment. Also show the two values
at that time.
