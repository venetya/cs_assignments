/*
Write a program that requests the hours worked in a week and then prints the gross pay,
the taxes, and the net pay. Assume the following:

a. Basic pay rate = $10.00/hr
b. Overtime (in excess of 40 hours) = time and a half
c. Tax rate: 
    15% of the first $300
    20% of the next $150
    25% of the rest

Use #define constants, and donâ€™t worry if the example does not conform to current
tax law.
 TAX1 = 45
45 + (PAY-BREAK1) * RATE2
400 - 300 = 100 * RATE2
TAX1 + TAX2 (45 + 30)
(550 - 300) > BREAK2
PAY - (BREAK1 + BREAK2) * .25
700 - 450 = 250 * .25
